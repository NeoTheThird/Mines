"The minefield is divided into a grid of squares. Touch a square to check if "
"there is a mine there. If no mine is present the square will show the number "
"of mines surrounding it. Use logic to determine a square that cannot contain "
"a mine to check next. If you hit a mine it explodes and the game is over. "
"You can flag where a mine is by touching and holding that square. Have fun!"
