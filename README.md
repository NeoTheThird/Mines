# Mines - Clear the minefield!

[![Mines](assets/Mines.png)](https://open.uappexplorer.com/app/Mines.neothethird)

This game is a fork of Robert Ancell's original work, which was inspired by various earlier games of the Minesweeper genre, dating back to Jerimac Ratliff's Cube, which was developed some time in the 60s. If you enjoy this game and you ever happen to meet one of them, please consider treating them for a decent cup of coffee, they really deserve it!

Written in QML for [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubports.com) (Phone and Tablet).

## How to play

Tap a tile to reveal what's underneath. If it's a bomb - you're dead. If not, you might see some numbers indicating how many of the adjacent tiles house bombs. Tap and hold a tile to plant a flag. Clear out the entire area to win!

## How to build

Set up [clickable](https://github.com/bhdouglass/clickable) and run `clickable` inside the working directory.
